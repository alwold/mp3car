This is my mp3 frontend for use in the car

Right now, it's pretty simple, but you can expect more in the future.

Future plans:
mikmod support
replace progress bar with adjustable slider
ffwd, rew support (with continuous operation if you hold it down)
saved playlists
multiple directory support
pixmaps on the main buttons

Installing:
Edit the Makefile/source if you want to do anything funky
Type make
Copy "mp3" to wherever
