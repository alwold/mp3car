Play spawns a child mpg123
each iteration of the gtk loop will read/write the mpg123 process if
the flag "mpg123 open" is on.  an array will hold pending mpg123 commands

send_mp3_cmd( int cmd, char *arg )
 cmd:
  play (arg song)
  stop
  ff
  rw
  next song
  prev song
  pause

int get_mp3_progress();
 returns seconds elapsed

close_mp3();?
